I am Angela Hannan. I work at UQ Library. I am currently creating a file at ResBaz 2016.

Favourite foods: pizza, bananas, fried rice. Dislike: Corrianda, miso soup.

Currently reading "The Martian". Very surprised that content that should be extremely boring has been made entertaining and gripping.
Well done Andy Weir.
